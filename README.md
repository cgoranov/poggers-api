# Poggers

Poggers is a one page application for you to create a list for all your most anticipated games with comments about each game too, so you never miss a detail when you are on your gaming Podcast!

## Overview

Poggers was created with a JavaScript frontend and Ruby on Rails API backend. I hope you enjoy!

## Local Installation

1. Clone the the backend API repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/cgoranov/poggers-api.git
```

2. Open the backend repository into your local IDE.

3. Inside the console run 'bundle install' to install the necessary Ruby Gems and dependencies:

```bash
bundle install
```

4. Run the database migrations:

```bash
rails db:migrate
```

5. Start the local rails server:

```bash
rails s
```

6. You are now all and can run your [frontend](https://github.com/cgoranov/poggers-frontend) as well!
